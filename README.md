- **Isolation of Work** :Team members to work on different features or bug fixes without interfering with each other's work.
- **Parallel Development** :Team members to work on different tasks simultaneously. This can significantly speed up the development process.
- **Code Review** :Team members can review each other's changes in a dedicated branch before merging them into the main codebase. And to resolve conflicts that may arise when multiple team members make changes to the same files.
- **Backup and Recovery** :If something goes wrong, team members can revert to a previous branch or commit to recover lost work.
