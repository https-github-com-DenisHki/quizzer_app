# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Issues

- The Spring Boot application won't start on my computer.
- I always have conflicts when I try to pull code from the GitHub.
- Not familiar with error handling and validation.
- Difficult to avoid merge conflicts.
- Lack of time due to a high workload.


## Actions

- Fix the broken Spring Boot setups together.
- Pull code from GitHub more often.
- Create smaller commits and push code to GitHub more often.
- Learn about it before next sprint.
- Improve time management.
