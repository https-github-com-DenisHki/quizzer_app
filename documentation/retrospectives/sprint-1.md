# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Issues

- The Spring Boot application won't start on my computer.
- I always have conflicts when I try to pull code from the GitHub.
- Not familiar with error handling and validation.
- Difficult to avoid merge conflicts.
- Lack of time due to a high workload.
- It is not clear how to organize simultaneous work on writing code. 
  It is always necessary to wait until one has finished his part before the other can begin his.
- Finding it challenging to understand and navigate through the existing codebase due to inconsistent naming conventions or lack of comments.


## Actions

- Fix the broken Spring Boot setups together.
- Pull code from GitHub more often.
- Create smaller commits and push code to GitHub more often.
- Learn about it before next sprint.
- Improve time management.
- Use descriptive names and add clear comments to make code easier to understand and navigate.
