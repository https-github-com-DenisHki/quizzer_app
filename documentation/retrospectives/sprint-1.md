# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Issues

- Not familiar with error handling and validation.
- Difficult to avoid merge conflicts.
- Lack of time due to a high workload.
- It is not clear how to organize simultaneous work on writing code. 
  It is always necessary to wait until one has finished his part before the other can begin his.
- Finding it challenging to understand and navigate through the existing codebase due to inconsistent naming conventions or lack of comments.


## Actions

- Make sure to learn about validation and error handling before next sprint.
- Every team member shall commit more often and remember to fetch and pull first every time before commencing new coding.
- Improve time management, and discuss  with team when necessary to better allocate workloads.
- Assign deadline for each task and assignee should strictly follow, enable all team members have better planning to conduct the work.
- Use descriptive names and add clear comments to make code easier to understand and navigate.
