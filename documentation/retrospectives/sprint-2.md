# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## Issues

-Info about dead lines is useful, but does not help to avoid "last minute" work overload.
-Unequal distribution of tasks.
-Lack of communication increases the amount of work that needs to be done and then redone again.

## Actions
-Encourage everyone to stick to deadline for progressing the teamwork and update status when help is needed.
-The next scrum master may work on that to allocate tasks  better  and reduce the workload stress over individual member.
-Encourge speak up when help is needed and maintain effective communication in Teams.

### Positive points
-Great team support
-Effective cooperation and productive work when we are in touch.
-An excellent opportunity to practice at all stages and all parts of project development.
